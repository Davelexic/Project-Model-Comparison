# Comparing Models

### Does complicating the model lead to better results?

**Thesis**

Why complicate something if it doesnt give you any added benefit. We are going to look into the use cases for models and see if complex models yield better results.

**Whats the outcome?** <br />
-We came to find if time and money are not a factor then with the right tuning a CNN model would preform well. Most of the time those variables are limited so making a simple deep learning provides almost as much insight with out the blood, sweat, and tears required to built and prep and CNN. We will continue to learn about this are and learn from our mistakes to evolve or pipeline so that it not so cumbersome.
